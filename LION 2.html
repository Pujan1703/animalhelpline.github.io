        The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the "big cats" and is known for its majestic appearance and strong, social behavior.
		Lions are typically found in grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands in Africa. They are characterized by their golden
		coats, impressive manes (in the case of males), and a powerful roar.

        Lions are apex predators and are known for living in prides, which are social groups consisting of related females 
		and their offspring, along with a few dominant males. They are carnivorous and primarily hunt large mammals such as 
		zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo.

        Lions are often considered symbols of strength and courage and have been featured in various cultures and as icons in 
		heraldry and mythology.
