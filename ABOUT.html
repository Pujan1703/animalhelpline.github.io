			 <h1><i style="color:red;"><u> ABOUT ANIMAL : </u></i></h1>
			 <p> "Animals improve the welfare of humans in many ways, ranging from providing companionship, improving mental health, 
                  facilitating rescues during natural disasters; and finally, for a number of species, as food. Dogs used in therapy,
                  and as aids for people with disabilities, provide important benefits."</p>
			 <p> Animals are integral parts of ecosystems, contributing to the conservation of ecological balance and biodiversity. They play a variety of
                 roles as pollinators, seed dispersers, predators and prey, ensuring the health and functioning of natural habitats.</p>
			 <p> "There are many different types of animals. The common animals most people know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. 
                  When biologists look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They use this to group the animals in a 
                  biological classification. Several million species may exist, but biologists have only identified about one million.
                  Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups: the invertebrates and the vertebrates. Vertebrates have a backbone, or spine; 
                  invertebrates do not. Vertebrates are the only group to have an adaptive immune system, which may be partly responsible for their 
                  size and success." </p>
			<h2 style="color:red;"><u>POINTS :</u></h2>	  
			<ol>				  
			<li><h3>Classification:</h3> Animals belong to the kingdom Animalia. This kingdom is further divided into various phyla, classes, orders, families, 
			genera, and species. The scientific classification of animals helps us understand their relationships and characteristics.</li><br>

            <li><h3>Diversity:</h3> Animals exhibit incredible diversity in terms of their anatomy, behavior, habitat, and reproductive strategies. From tiny
			insects to massive whales, the animal kingdom encompasses an astonishing range of life forms.</li><br>

            <li><h3>Habitats:</h3> Animals inhabit a wide array of environments, including oceans, forests, grasslands, deserts, mountains, and more. 
			Some are adapted to thrive in specific habitats, while others have more generalist lifestyles.</li><br>

            <li><h3>Adaptations:</h3> Animals have evolved various adaptations to survive and thrive in their environments. These adaptations can include 
			physical features like camouflage, sharp claws, keen senses, and specialized feeding structures.</li><br>

            <li><h3>Reproduction:</h3> Animals reproduce through various methods, including sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction 
			involves the fusion of gametes (sperm and egg cells) from two parents, leading to genetic diversity within populations.</li><br>

            <li><h3>Behavior:</h3> Animal behavior varies widely and includes aspects like feeding, communication, mating rituals, migration, and social 
			interactions. Many animals exhibit complex behaviors that are often tied to their survival and reproductive success.</li><br>

            <li><h3>Ecological Roles:</h3> Animals play vital roles in ecosystems. They can be predators, prey, pollinators, scavengers, decomposers, and 
			more. These roles contribute to the overall health and functioning of ecosystems.</li><br>

			<li><h3>Conservation:</h3> Many animal species are threatened by factors such as habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and overexploitation.
			Conservation efforts aim to protect and preserve endangered species and their habitats.</li><br>

            <li><h3>Domestication:</h3> Some animals have been domesticated by humans for various purposes, including companionship, work, transportation, 
			and agriculture. Dogs, cats, cows, horses, and chickens are just a few examples of domesticated animals.</li><br>

			<li><h3>Ethics and Rights:</h3> The treatment of animals has led to discussions about animal rights and ethical considerations. Different cultures
			and societies hold varying beliefs about how animals should be treated and whether they have intrinsic value beyond human use.</li><br>

            <li><h3>Extinction and Evolution:</h3> Throughout Earth's history, numerous animal species have gone extinct due to natural factors and human 
			activities. Evolution continues to shape the animal kingdom, leading to new species over time.</li><br> </p>
