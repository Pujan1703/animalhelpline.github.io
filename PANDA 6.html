    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>The giant panda is known for its black and white fur, with black patches around its eyes, ears, and limbs. They have 
	a stocky build and a distinctive, round face. Red pandas, on the other hand, are smaller and have a rust-colored coat with a bushy tail.</p>
    
    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Giant pandas are found in bamboo forests in the mountainous regions of China, while red pandas inhabit the forests of 
	the Himalayas and surrounding areas. Bamboo is the primary food source for both species.</p>
    
    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>Giant pandas are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and low reproduction rates. Conservation efforts, 
	including breeding programs, have been implemented to protect them. Red pandas are also facing threats and are classified as endangered.</p>

    <h2>Pandas are not only cherished for their adorable appearance but also play a crucial role in biodiversity and 
	conservation efforts in their native habitats.</h2>
