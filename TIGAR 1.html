        <li>TIGAR (TP53-Induced Glycolysis and Apoptosis Regulator) is a protein that plays a role in regulating glycolysis and 
		apoptosis in cells. It is induced by the TP53 gene, also known as the p53 gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene. 
		TIGAR's main function is to reduce glycolysis and promote the pentose phosphate pathway, which can help protect cells 
		from oxidative stress and promote cell survival. Additionally, TIGAR can inhibit apoptosis, which is programmed cell 
		death. Understanding the role of TIGAR in cellular processes is important in cancer research and the study of cell 
		survival mechanisms.</li>
		<li>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most 
		recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys
		on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring
		large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay 
		with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish 
		their own.</li>
